// webhook.ts
// Receives webhook events from LiveKit and decides whether to start or stop
// a bridge session based on whether the room has linked audience channels.
//
// LiveKit fires room_started when the first participant joins a room,
// and room_finished when the last participant leaves.
//
// The webhook endpoint is POST /webhook
// LiveKit signs the payload with a JWT — we verify it before acting.
